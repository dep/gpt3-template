Very basic template for a GPT-3 enabled app that has the ability to
change a text model based on a dropdown. The model text for each
dropdown item is stored in a JSON file.

# Getting started

You'll need an OpenAI [API Key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to run this app.

Highly recommended to use repo secrets to insert the key into `<repo>/index.js`.

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run server` to start the backend
4. Run `npm run start` to start the frontend
5. Browse to `http://localhost:3000`
